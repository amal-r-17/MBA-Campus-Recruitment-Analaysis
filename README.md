# MBA-Campus-Recruitment-Analaysis
Done as a part of my Course work, this is an analysis on the MBA campus recruitment data.

Thorough analysis was done of the data and the key factors affecting the chance of a student being placed were found out.

Finally a classification model was built that finds out whether a student would get placed or not.

The notebook provided has detailed explanation of all steps along with insights obtained from each of the visvualisations.
